# Hello, I'm Isabela! 💻🙂

I’ve worked as a UX Writer for four years, and I’m currently applying for the **Associate Technical Writer** position at Liferay. In this space, I’ll share a bit about my process while completing the three exercises you suggested.

### Exercise 1 | The DVR Manual

#### Objective:

Create a clear tutorial with an introduction and two sections (Playback and Recording), designed for a general audience.

#### Approach:

- I started with a didactic introduction, explaining what a DVR is and what the user would learn, providing context right from the start. Then, I divided the content into **concept + instruction**.

- Each section starts with a conceptual explanation (“What is DVR Playback?” / “How recording works”) followed by a numbered step-by-step guide outlining the user actions.

- I chose to **avoid technical jargon**, keeping the language close to everyday speech and using familiar words.

- The tone remains **instructional** and **accessible**, prioritizing short sentences and consistent verb usage.

- I used spacing and subheadings to maintain **formatting** and **scannability**, allowing users to quickly find the information they need.

- I **would have included visual aids**, but since the format did not allow it, I tried to describe scenarios in as much detail as possible.

- I followed best documentation practices based on these three steps:

**1. Introduce the concept**

**2. List the actions**

**3. Indicate the expected result**

The final result is a tutorial that fulfills both pedagogical and technical functions, resembling a real mini user manual.

### Exercise 2 | Wordsmithing

#### Objective:
Rewrite, correct, and condense a technical post that was originally confusing, improving its clarity, tone, and technical accuracy.

#### Approach:

- I started by analyzing the original text to identify the core technical issue: the inefficiency of Ehcache’s RMI replication mechanism and the excessive use of threads.

- Then, I reorganized the content to make the text flow more smoothly. I removed redundancies (such as “even more worse”, “disaster”, and “we need to fix...”), adjusted verb tenses for consistency, and improved sentence structure.

- I rewrote long or repetitive sentences into shorter, more direct ones to improve readability and cohesion. I kept the technical terms but provided additional context where necessary.

- Grammar, punctuation, and tone were aligned with standard English technical writing conventions. I also used active voice and concise phrasing to enhance clarity and flow, ensuring terminology consistency throughout the text.

- According to a grammar check tool, the final version showed a 136% improvement in grammar, fluency, and clarity combined.

The result is a clear, concise, and technically accurate text that effectively communicates the optimization process while maintaining a professional tone consistent with enterprise-level.

# Hello, I'm Isabela! 💻🙂

I’ve worked as a UX Writer for four years, and I’m currently applying for the **Associate Technical Writer** position at Liferay. In this space, I’ll share a bit about my process while completing the three exercises you suggested.
#

### Exercise 1 | The DVR Manual

#### Objective:

Create a clear tutorial with an introduction and two sections (Playback and Recording), designed for a general audience.

#### Approach:

- I started with a didactic introduction, explaining what a DVR is and what the user would learn, providing context right from the start. Then, I divided the content into **concept + instruction**.

- Each section starts with a conceptual explanation (“What is DVR Playback?” / “How recording works”) followed by a numbered step-by-step guide outlining the user actions.

- I chose to **avoid technical jargon**, keeping the language close to everyday speech and using familiar words.

- The tone remains **instructional** and **accessible**, prioritizing short sentences and consistent verb usage.

- I used spacing and subheadings to maintain **formatting** and **scannability**, allowing users to quickly find the information they need.

- I **would have included visual aids**, but since the format did not allow it, I tried to describe scenarios in as much detail as possible.

- I followed best documentation practices based on these three steps:

**1. Introduce the concept**

**2. List the actions**

**3. Indicate the expected result**

The final result is a tutorial that fulfills both pedagogical and technical functions, resembling a real mini user manual.

### Exercise 2 | Wordsmithing

#### Objective:
Rewrite, correct, and condense a technical post that was originally confusing, improving its clarity, tone, and technical accuracy.

#### Approach:

- I started by analyzing the original text to identify the core technical issue: the inefficiency of Ehcache’s RMI replication mechanism and the excessive use of threads.

- Then, I reorganized the content to make the text **flow more smoothly**. I removed redundancies (such as “even more worse”, “disaster”, and “we need to fix...”), adjusted verb tenses for consistency, and improved sentence structure.

- I **rewrote** long or repetitive sentences into shorter, more direct ones to improve **readability** and **cohesion**. I kept the technical terms but provided additional context where necessary.

- **Grammar**, **punctuation**, and **tone** were aligned according **English grammar**. I also used active voice and concise phrasing to enhance clarity and flow, ensuring terminology consistency throughout the text.

- According to a **grammar check** tool, the final version showed a **136% improvement** in grammar, fluency, and clarity combined.

The result is a clear, concise, and technically accurate text that effectively communicates the optimization process while maintaining a professional tone consistent with enterprise-level.

### Exercise 3 | Javadoc

#### Objective:
Write the Javadoc for the _insert(...)_ method, following the Liferay Javadoc Guidelines.

#### Approach:

This was definitely the **most challenging** task for me, since I had never written documentation directly in Javadoc before. I had to start by **learning** how Javadoc works, what its structure is, how to describe parameters and return values, and where to include examples of code usage.

I read through the Liferay Javadoc Guidelines and several examples from open-source projects to understand the writing pattern and tone. Then, I focused on keeping my documentation concise, precise, and consistent, describing each parameter in a way that would help a developer understand the method’s behavior without needing to read the code itself.

After finishing my version, I also **checked** it with a few developer friends to confirm that the explanations were **technically accurate** and that the tone matched the expected standard for developer documentation.

The final documentation clearly explains the method’s purpose, parameters, return value, and behavior when the input is null. I learned a lot from this exercise, especially about how to balance clarity, technical precision, and proper formatting within a structured documentation format like Javadoc.
The result is a clear, concise, and technically accurate text that effectively communicates the optimization process while maintaining a professional tone consistent with enterprise-level.

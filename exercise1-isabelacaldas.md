## How to use this DVR

### About

A DVR (Digital Video Recorder) is a device that records video in digital format to a local storage device, such as a hard drive, memory card, or other media. If you have never used a DVR before, this guide will help you understand the basic features.

In this tutorial, you will learn two key functions: how to control playback (play, pause, stop, fast-forward, and rewind) and how to record a TV show. Each section includes simple explanations and step-by-step instructions.

### Section 1 - Playback Controls

#### What is DVR Playback?

Playback refers to watching a TV show or recording that is already stored on the DVR. Instead of watching live television, you can play something that has already been recorded, just like using a video player.

Playback includes functions such as playing, pausing, rewinding, and fast-forwarding recorded programs or live content (when supported).

#### Playback Controls

1. **Play** - Starts the video from the beginning or from where it was last stopped.  
2. **Pause** - Temporarily stops the video but keeps your place.  
3. **Stop** - Ends playback and returns to the previous screen.  
4. **Rewind** - Moves backward in the video.  
5. **Fast-forward** - Skips ahead in the video.  

#### How to use Playback Controls (step-by-step)

1. Press the **Menu** or **Recorded Shows** button on the remote to open the list of saved programs.  
2. Select the show you want to watch and press **OK** or **Enter**.  
3. Press **Play** to start watching.  
4. Press **Pause** to temporarily stop the video.  
5. Press **Play** again to continue.  
6. Use **Fast-forward** to skip ahead.  
7. Use **Rewind** to go back.  
8. Press **Stop** when you want to finish watching.

### Section 2 - Recording TV Shows and Movies

#### How recording works

Recording allows you to save a TV program while it is airing and watch it later. The DVR stores the content internally, so you can choose when to watch it and play back any part of the program at your own pace.

#### How to record a show (step-by-step)

1. Turn on the TV and DVR.  
2. Open the **Program Guide** using the remote control.  
3. Use the arrow buttons to select the program you want to record.  
4. Press the **Record** button (often labeled *REC* or shown as a red circle).  
5. Choose whether you want to record a single episode or the entire series (if available).  
6. A recording icon will appear on screen to confirm that the recording has been scheduled.

#### Additional recording options

- **Schedule a future recording** — You can select a program that has not started yet and set it to record automatically.  
- **Record while watching live TV** — Press the **Record** button at any time during a live broadcast to start recording instantly.  
- **Access saved recordings later** — Open the **Recorded Shows** or **Library** menu to view saved content.
